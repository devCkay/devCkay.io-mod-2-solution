        <h1>Chicken</h1>
        <p>
          The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
          species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the
          Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
          Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male
          may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
          An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
          called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
          food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally
          they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some
          places. The chicken domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its
          eggs are Layers.

        <h1>Beef</h1>
        <p>
          Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). In
          prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated
          them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred
          specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is
          the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and
          poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the
          largest producers of beef. Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts
          are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of
          doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most
          hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with
          other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an
          increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease,
          especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being
          a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas
          emissions of any agricultural product.

        <h1>Sushi</h1>
        <p>
          sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked
          rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw
          seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in sushi
          abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating
          clientele, and the dish has gained popularity in the United States and
          elsewhere (see also sashimi).
